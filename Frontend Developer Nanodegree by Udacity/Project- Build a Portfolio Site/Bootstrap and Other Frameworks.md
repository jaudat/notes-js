## Bootstrap Structure

columns must be under a .row class which must be under a .container(fixed-width) or .container-fluid(full-width) class. The container class makes sure that the margins on the side look good

## MISC
* For responsive images we should add the class .img-responsive to the class in the img tag
* For text we can see the typography section of Bootstrap. Therefore for alighnment for example we can use classes such as text-left, text-center etc. There are also transformation classes such as text-uppercase etc.
