# Getting Up and Running

"Create a product, don't re-imagine one for the small screen, great mobile products are created, never ported" - Brian Fling

Images on average consume more than [60%](http://httparchive.org/interesting.php#bytesperpage) of the bytes to open a web page, and images may not work so well on screens on different sizes. For example a fixed sized image can get cropped on a phone, needing us to scroll horizontally and vertically or pixelation if an image is stretched for display.

We must strive to deliver the highest quality images with the fewesst bytes possible.

We can test the responsiveness of our website by using:
