# HTML, CSS and Boxes

HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the language of the web. It defines the structure and content of the page. HTML has syntax and rules. The basic syntax of HTML is a tag. The browser turns each tag into a node/element in a tree. It knows how to do that because of the Document Object Model (DOM). Which is a standard convention for representing and interacting with elements in HTML. So the browser builds a DOM tree with the HTML document provided. Each tag can have attributes and their corresponding values, so for example in the following `<h1 class="article"> </h1>` the h1 tag has a class attribute and article as it's value.

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is another language that allows us to change how elements look on a page. It is cascading because the most specific rule will apply to the element. CSS uses selctors to know which elements to apply the styling on.
