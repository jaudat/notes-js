# Why Responsive?

## Testing
When testing the responsiveness of our website to different devices with their different dimensions, it is prohibitively expensive to buy all the devices ourselves to test them on. We can instead use emulators or simulators. Here are some tools we can use: 
* We can use the [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/) to test the responsive layout of our website, by using real devices.
* We can also test using Google Chrome's web tools emulator. The instructions can be found at the [Google Developers site](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/inspect-styles/shortcuts).
* We can also debug remotely on our android device, using the instructions from the [Google developer website](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/remote-debugging/?hl=en)
* For remote debugging with an ios device, we can use [ios webkit debug proxy](https://github.com/google/ios-webkit-debug-proxy)
* We can also use an iOS emulator, the instructions on how to do it from [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/09/testing-mobile-emulators-simulators-remote-debugging/2/)
